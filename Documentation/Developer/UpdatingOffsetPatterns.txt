Follow these steps to fix/update byte patterns that have been broken by LeagueOfLegends patches 

1. Begin a game of TFT
2. Dump the process memory using LeagueDumper
	.\pd.exe -p ".*League of Legends.*"

* The executable can be found in this project or on Github

..\TFTBuddy\Tools\LeagueDumper\pd.exe
or
https://github.com/tarekwiz/LeagueDumper

3. Open the dump in IDA by starting IDA and dragging the dump file into the editor and selecting yes/ok to all of IDA's prompts and dialogs. Just to re-iterate, 
   let IDA decide how to handle the file. No need to change any options.

* The dump filename should look similar to "League of Legends_exe_PID3224_League of Legends.exe_7FF6A2850000_x64.exe". If you are still unsure,
  it is likely the largest or second largest file from the dump. 

* IDA

4. Once loaded, press Shift+F12 to show all strings from the dump
5. Press Ctrl+F and search for keywords that may interact with the data or function you're trying to locate

* For example, searching for "you"  return results like  "game_announcement_replace_you", which we can assume is a function or data object that works closely 
  with player data. 

6. Double-click on a search result to be taken to its implementation
7. Press X on the implementation line to get all references to it

* It may or may not matter which reference you choose
* If it does not take you to a graph view, right-click and select "Graph view" from the context-menu

8. Try to derive the pointer of the data you're targeting from the relationships presented on the graph view. 

* In the example from step 5, we can get the local player pointer on this graph by following it up one level to where it is being passed as "qword_7FF6A7A2A528"

9. Once found, highlight the address and select Edit > Plugins > SigMakerEx > Function or Address to generate a new byte pattern in the Output window

* The SigMakerEx plugin can be found here (https://github.com/kweatherman/sigmakerex/releases). Unzip and paste the DLLs into the IDA plugins directory (Typically C:\Program Files\IDA    7.3\plugins)

10. Update the byte pattern in "TFTBuddy\TFTBuddy\TFTBuddy.Resources\TFT_BytePatterns.json"
